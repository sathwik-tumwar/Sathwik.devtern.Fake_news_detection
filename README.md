# Fake_news_detection
### Objective:
Differentiate between real and fake news using a Python project applying a PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
### Tasks:
1) Read and explore the textual dataset.
2) Build a machine learning model with TfidfVectorizer and PassiveAggressiveClassifier.
3) Create a confusion matrix to evaluate the model's performance.
4) Measure the model's accuracy.
### Deliverables:
1) Report on detecting fake news using Python, covering data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
2) Python code for data preprocessing, model construction, and confusion matrix generation.
